# Voice Agent Guide

A comprehensive guide to building real-time voice agents using open-source models and frameworks.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of blog posts and resources that walk you through creating your own voice agent from scratch. Learn how to build conversational AI that listens, thinks, and responds naturally in real-time.

## What You'll Learn

- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Voice Activity Detection and transcription models
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**: Choosing and integrating the right brain for your agent
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Natural voice synthesis and streaming
- **Speech-to-Speech Models**: End-to-end conversation pipelines
- **Frameworks**: Orchestrating everything with Pipecat and other tools
- **Deployment**: Production-ready voice agent strategies

## Blog Series
